## Advent of Code 2019 Solutions in Kotlin

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/tginsberg/advent-2019-kotlin)]()

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2019](http://adventofcode.com/2019) set of problems with the Kotlin programming language.

I am trying to solve these on the day they are posted with clear, idiomatic solutions. That means in some cases I will sacrifice performance for a more clear solution. Unlike [2017](https://github.com/tginsberg/advent-2017-kotlin) and [2018](https://github.com/tginsberg/advent-2018-kotlin), I have some travel commitments in December, so while I will endeavour to have these done day-of I can't promise it. We'll see how it goes! :)
